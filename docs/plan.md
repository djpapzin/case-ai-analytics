# Implementation Plan for AI Automation Developer Assessment

## Overview
This document outlines the complete plan for implementing the project. The assessment consists of two main parts:
- **Part A:** Build a machine learning model to predict case outcomes using case management system data.
- **Part B:** Develop an AI agent to extract insights from the case management data.

## Detailed Plan

   - **Preprocessing:** ‚úÖ
     - Implemented table merging with proper keys
     - Added missing value handling with imputation
     - Implemented feature normalization using StandardScaler
     - Added categorical encoding (one-hot)
   - **Time-based Split:** ‚úÖ
     - Implemented TimeBasedSplitter class
     - Added date validation and analysis
     - Included visualization of split distribution
     - Added fallback to random split if needed

2. **Model Development** ‚úÖ
   - **Model Selection:** Implemented Random Forest classifier to predict case resolution statuses.
   - **Training & Evaluation:** 
     - Trained the model on the preprocessed dataset.
     - Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
     - Analyzed feature importance to understand influential factors.
   - **Bonus:** Deployed the model as an API using FastAPI.

### Part B: AI Agent for Case Insights ‚úÖ
1. **Data Analysis & Visualization** ‚úÖ

   - Calculated summary statistics and generated visualizations (e.g., most common case types, average resolution times, assignee performance).
   - Used statistical analysis techniques to analyze case data.

2. **AI Agent Implementation** ‚úÖ
   - Developed functions that answer key business questions:
     - What are the most common types of cases?
     - Which factors contribute most to resolution time?
     - Which assignees have the highest resolution rates?
     - Are there patterns in escalations related to client demographics or case types?
   - Implemented the insights through a FastAPI endpoint.
