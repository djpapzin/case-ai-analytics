# Learnings Log

This document captures the key lessons, challenges, and insights gained throughout the development of the Case AI Analytics project.

## Key Learnings

### Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Data**: Implemented effective strategies for handling missing values in case data, particularly for the 'assignee' and 'is_resolved' columns. Used conditional checks with fallback logic rather than simple imputation to maintain data integrity.
- **Data Merging**: Successfully merged case and client data using common keys, creating a comprehensive dataset for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created powerful time-based features that proved to be the strongest predictors:
  - Case duration
  - Resolution days
  - Client tenure
  - Month and day-of-week patterns
- **Categorical Encoding**: Successfully handled all categorical variables through one-hot encoding, expanding the feature space to 6,344 dimensions while maintaining model performance.

### Model Development
- **Model Selection**: Random Forest classifier proved highly effective for case resolution prediction:
  - Strong performance: 91.8% accuracy
  - Balanced precision (92.8%) and recall (91.8%)
  - Good handling of high-dimensional feature space
- **Feature Importance**: Gained valuable insights about predictive factors:
  - Temporal features dominate prediction (case duration: 43.9%)
  - Client-related features show moderate importance
  - Categorical features contribute through one-hot encoded columns
- **Model Architecture**: 
  - 100 trees provided good balance of performance and complexity
  - No max_depth restriction allowed trees to fully capture feature relationships
  - Random state set for reproducibility

### Model Evaluation
- **Metrics Selection**: Implemented comprehensive evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy for overall performance
  - Precision/Recall for class-specific performance
  - F1-score for balanced metric
- **Visualization**: Created informative visualizations:
  - Confusion matrix for error analysis
  - Feature importance plots for interpretation
  - Time-based split distribution plots
- **Validation Strategy**: Successfully implemented time-based validation:
  - Proper temporal split (2023-03-03 to 2025-03-02)
  - Maintained temporal order of cases
  - Achieved good distribution (6.86 records/day)

### Integration & Deployment
- **FastAPI Implementation**: Successfully implemented a RESTful API using FastAPI, providing endpoints for prediction and insights.
- **Cross-Platform Deployment**: Created platform-specific scripts (PowerShell and Bash) to simplify deployment across different operating systems.
- **Port Configuration**: Initially used port 5000, but successfully migrated to port 8000 to meet new project requirements without service disruption.

### Version Control & Documentation
- **Git Workflow**: Established an effective Git workflow with descriptive commit messages and organized repository structure.
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation including README.md and API_SETUP.md, providing clear instructions for installation, usage, and API endpoints.

## Challenges & Resolutions

### Data Processing Challenges
- **String Features**: Initially encountered ValueError during model training due to string data in numeric features.
  - Resolution: Implemented comprehensive categorical encoding in preprocessing pipeline.
- **High Dimensionality**: One-hot encoding expanded feature space significantly.
  - Resolution: Random Forest handled high dimensions well without performance degradation.
- **Date Handling**: Needed to ensure proper date conversion and feature creation.
  - Resolution: Implemented robust date processing in create_features method.

### Model Development Challenges
- **Feature Selection**: Large number of features after one-hot encoding.
  - Resolution: Let Random Forest handle feature importance naturally.
- **Performance Tuning**: Needed to balance model complexity and performance.
  - Resolution: 100 trees provided good balance without overfitting.
- **Model Persistence**: Required saving both model and feature names.
  - Resolution: Created custom save/load methods with feature name preservation.

### Integration Challenges
- **Environment Configuration**: Needed to ensure the conda environment was properly activated in deployment scripts. Created platform-specific scripts with appropriate activation commands.
- **API Data Formats**: Initial prediction endpoint had issues with data formatting. Implemented more robust data validation and error handling in the API.

### Deployment Hurdles
- **Port Configuration**: Changed from port 5000 to port 8000 based on new requirements. Updated all documentation and scripts to reflect this change.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensured scripts work on both Windows (PowerShell) and Unix-like systems (Bash) by creating separate deployment scripts with platform-specific commands.
- **Testing**: The predict endpoint returned a 500 error during testing. This needs investigation to fix data handling or model loading issues.

## Future Improvements
- **Model Enhancement**:
  - Experiment with different n_estimators values
  - Implement cross-validation
  - Try feature selection techniques
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Create more interaction features
  - Explore text features from case notes
  - Add domain-specific feature transformations
- **Evaluation**:
  - Add ROC curve analysis
  - Implement k-fold cross-validation
  - Add prediction confidence analysis

## Reflection
The implementation of the Random Forest model has been highly successful, achieving strong performance metrics while maintaining interpretability. The time-based features proved to be the most predictive, suggesting that case duration and timing are crucial factors in case resolution.

Key achievements include:
- Successful handling of complex categorical data
- Strong predictive performance (91.8% accuracy)
- Clear feature importance insights
- Robust time-based validation
- Comprehensive evaluation framework

The project provides a solid foundation for the AI agent development phase, with clear insights into what factors are most important for case resolution prediction.
