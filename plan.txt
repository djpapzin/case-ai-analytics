# Implementation Plan for AI Automation Developer Assessment

## Overview
This document outlines the complete plan for implementing the project. The assessment consists of two main parts:
- **Part A:** Build a machine learning model to predict case outcomes using case management system data.
- **Part B:** Develop an AI agent to extract insights from the case management data.

## Detailed Plan

### Part A: Machine Learning Model Implementation ✅
1. **Data Preparation** ✅
   - **Synthetic Data Generation:** Create at least three related tables (e.g., Cases, Clients, and an optional third table) to mimic a real case management system.
   - **Preprocessing:** 
     - Merge/join tables using common keys.
     - Handle missing values using imputation or removal.
     - Normalize/scale numerical features.
     - Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding or label encoding).
   - **Bonus:** Implement a time-based train-test split (using older cases for training and newer cases for testing).

2. **Model Development** ✅
   - **Model Selection:** Started with Random Forest classifier to predict case resolution statuses.
   - **Training & Evaluation:** 
     - Trained the model on the preprocessed dataset.
     - Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
     - Analyzed feature importance to understand influential factors.
   - **Bonus:** Deployed the model as an API using FastAPI.

### Part B: AI Agent for Case Insights ✅
1. **Data Analysis & Visualization** ✅
   - Loaded and processed the case management data.
   - Calculated summary statistics and generated visualizations (e.g., most common case types, average resolution times, assignee performance).
   - Used statistical analysis techniques to analyze case data.

2. **AI Agent Implementation** ✅
   - Developed functions that answer key business questions:
     - What are the most common types of cases?
     - Which factors contribute most to resolution time?
     - Which assignees have the highest resolution rates?
     - Are there patterns in escalations related to client demographics or case types?
   - Implemented the insights through a FastAPI endpoint.
